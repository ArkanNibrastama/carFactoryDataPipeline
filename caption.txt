Recently, I worked on a hands-on project to explore how data lakehouse architecture can help automotive manufacturers — especially Chinese EV brands entering Indonesia — optimize their factory operations.

Here’s the story 👇

🚗 The context
Indonesia is aiming for 600K electric vehicles by 2030.
To meet that, brands like Wuling, BYD, and Chery are building local factories.
But scaling production efficiently is tough when:
- Machines may fail without warning
- Data lives in different systems
- Decisions are based on guesswork not insights

⚠️ The challenges
- IoT sensor data exists, but it’s only used for monitoring — not predicting failures
- Supply chain data is stored in legacy databases (PostgreSQL)
- CRM and sales data are stuck in spreadsheets or cloud tools
- No unified platform to connect and analyze everything

🏗️ The solution: a hybrid data lakehouse
I designed a pipeline that blends real-time streaming and batch processing to turn disconnected data into actionable insights:
- IoT sensor data → streamed via Kafka for real-time monitoring + stored for ML and analytics
- PostgreSQL (CDC) → captured with Debezium to track supply chain events
- CRM data → ingested in batch with Airflow and centralized for analysis

🛠️ Tech stack
Kafka for streaming ingestion
- Apache Flink for real-time processing
- PostgreSQL + Debezium for CDC
- ClickHouse for operational analytics
- Apache Spark for batch processing
- Apache Iceberg for the lakehouse table format
- MinIO for cloud-native object storage
- Airflow for orchestration
- Trino for interactive SQL queries
- Project Nessie for Git-like data versioning
- Superset for dashboarding

✅ With this architecture, the factory can:
- Prevent machine failures with predictive maintenance
- Align production with real market demand
- Make faster, data-driven decisions across teams

This hands-on project helped me connect my passion for data engineering with real industrial challenges — and see how powerful modern data architecture can be when it’s applied right.
