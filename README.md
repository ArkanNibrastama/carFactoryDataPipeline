# Data Lakehouse Project for Automotive Manufacturing

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the development of a modern, end-to-end data pipeline using a **Data Lakehouse** architecture, with a specific case study focused on **Chinese automotive manufacturers establishing factories in Indonesia**. As Indonesia targets over 2 million electric cars on the road by 2030, Chinese brands like Wuling, BYD, and Chery are setting up local production. To compete effectively in the price-sensitive Indonesian market and build long-term consumer trust, maintaining high quality control and consistent production is crucial. This project is designed to tackle the core operational challenges these new factories will face.

### Business Challenges
Manufacturing plants face two primary challenges:
1.  **Unexpected Machine Failures:** Although production machinery is equipped with IoT sensors, the data is typically used only for monitoring rather than for predictive purposes. As a result, potential issues often go unnoticed until they cause costly breakdowns, leading to expensive production halts and impacting cost efficiency.
2.  **Siloed Data Systems:** Supply chain data is stored in legacy databases, while sales and customer demand insights reside in separate CRM systems. Without seamless integration, manufacturers struggle to accurately align production schedules with market demand, hindering their ability to scale up and meet production targets.

### Data Engineering Solution
To address these challenges, this project propose a data engineering solution by building a centralized data platform. This platform integrates data from various sources (IoT, legacy databases, and CRM) into a **Data Lakehouse**. This architecture not only unifies the data but also enables advanced analytics, such as predictive maintenance for production machinery and more accurate sales forecasting for business planning.



## **Project Goals**

* **Build a Centralized Data Platform:** Integrate data from siloed sources (IoT, PostgreSQL, CRM) into a reliable single source of truth.
* **Implement Predictive Maintenance:** Transform IoT sensor data from simple monitoring feeds into predictive insights to reduce machine downtime.
* **Improve Forecasting Accuracy:** Align sales and supply chain data to enhance the accuracy of market demand forecasting and production planning.
* **Design a Scalable Architecture:** Establish a modern and scalable data foundation using Data Lakehouse technology with Apache Iceberg to support future business growth.


## **Solution**

The data pipeline architecture is designed to handle both real-time and batch data, with the Data Lakehouse at its core.

**Architecture Workflow:**
1.  **Data Sources:** Data originates from three main sources: **IoT** sensors on factory machines, **PostgreSQL** for supply chain data, and a **CRM** for sales data.
2.  **Data Ingestion:**
    * Streaming IoT data is sent through **Apache Kafka**.
    * Batch data from the CRM and PostgreSQL is ingested using the **Apache Airflow** workflow orchestrator.
3.  **Processing & Transformation:**
    * Streaming data from Kafka is processed by Spark Streaming/Flink jobs.
    * Airflow orchestrates data transformation (ETL/ELT) jobs using **Apache Spark**.
4.  **Storage (Data Lakehouse):**
    * **MinIO** serves as an S3-compatible object storage layer for all data.
    * **Apache Iceberg** acts as the open table format on top of MinIO, providing critical features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel.
    * **Nessie** functions as a catalog for Iceberg, enabling Git-like data semantics (e.g., branching, tagging, merging).
5.  **Model Development & Analysis:**
    * Data from the Lakehouse is used to train machine learning models (e.g., for predictive maintenance) with **Python** and **Scikit-learn**. The resulting models are then integrated back into the pipeline.
    * **Trino** is used as the query engine for fast, ad-hoc analytics directly on the Data Lakehouse.
6.  **Visualization & Reporting:**
    * **Apache Superset** connects to Trino to create interactive dashboards and business reports, such as OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) monitoring or sales trend visualizations.



## **Key Features**

* **Real-time and Batch Ingestion:** Capable of handling high-velocity data from IoT sensors and transactional data from business systems.
* **Data Lakehouse Platform with Apache Iceberg:** Provides data warehouse-level reliability (ACID, DML) with the scalability and flexibility of a data lake.
* **"Git-like" Data Management:** Uses Nessie for reliable data versioning, ensuring data consistency and reproducibility.
* **Reliable Pipeline Orchestration:** The entire data pipeline is centrally orchestrated and scheduled using Apache Airflow.
* **Fast and Interactive Analytics:** Allows analysts and data scientists to run complex SQL queries quickly using Trino without moving data.
* **Full Machine Learning Lifecycle:** Supports the end-to-end process from model development and deployment to leveraging model outputs for decision-making.
